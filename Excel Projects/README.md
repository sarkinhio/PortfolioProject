# Mopito store data analysis

Dashboard created by using Microsoft Excel.

## Objective:

Mopito store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022 in order to understand what customers want and grow next years sales.

## Tasks:
1. Compare the sales and orders using single chart
2. Which month got the highest sales and orders?
3. Who purchased more: men or women?
4. What are different order status in 2022?
5. TOP 10 states contributing most to the sales
6. Relation between age & gender based on number of orders
7. Which channel is contributing most to increase sales?
8. Which category is the highest selling?

## Data Cleaning:
- Modified 'Gender' column by changing W to Women and M to Men
- Generalized format on 'Category' column
- Changed format to UPPER letters for 'Ship-city' column because data was messy

## Data Processing:
- Generalized 'Age Group' column into three categories so the data would be more useful
- Splitted 'Date' column into Months in order for the data to be usable in visualizations

## Data Visualization:
- Created pivot tables & charts 
- Added interactable filters for the management to view data easier
- Created dashboard

## Key Insights:
- Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~69%)
- California, Washington and Nevada are the TOP 3 states (~64%)
- Adult age group (30-49 years old) is contributing most (~50%)
- Amazon, AliExpress, Flipkart are most contributing channels (~81%)
